    <p>I am Mckinley Faustin, a full-stack web developer based out of Charlotte North Carolina. I started my career in Wells Fargo as a Small Business Banker.    <br> From there, I noticed systems and processes that needed to be updated. Started playing with updating PDF documents and then updating forms that can automatically create an email     <br>if you go through the prompts. After falling in love with technology and finding more efficient ways to enhanse a current process.    <br>I decided to take focus on building applications to solve real world problems. With my experience I have excellent verbal and written communication skills.    <br> I am goal-oriented individual with strong leadership capabilities. I am proficient in Adobe, Microsoft Office, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, jQuery, Node.js, MySQL and MongoDB.     <br>I also have the ability to work in a fast-paced deadline driven environment.</p>
